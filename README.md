---
### Objectives:
1. Integrate OPA with Jenkins to enforce compliance checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Write Rego policies to define compliance rules.
3. Simulate compliance failures and verify how OPA handles these failures.

### Conclusion:
This lab demonstrates how to integrate OPA with Jenkins for enforcing compliance checks in a CI/CD pipeline. You learned how to set up OPA, write Rego policies, integrate those policies into a Jenkins pipeline, and simulate compliance failures to verify OPA's responses. This setup ensures that only compliant applications are built and deployed, enhancing the security and governance of your CI/CD process.
